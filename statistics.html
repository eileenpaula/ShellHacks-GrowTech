                <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Source: U.S. Equal Economic Opportunity Commission's <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech" target="_blank">Diversity in Tech Report</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As seen in the figure above the demographic ratio in the U.S. technology industry is extremely skewed in favor of people who are White. Specifically, those who are <strong>hispanic and black are very underrepresented</strong>. In addition, there is also a major gender gap in the technology industry. According to <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/women-in-tech-statistics/#:~:text=Women%20in%20tech%20statistics%20shed,gap%20in%20the%20technology%20business.&text=Only%2024%25%20of%20computing%20jobs,45%25%20higher%20rate%20than%20men." target="_blank">dataprot.net</a>, <span style="font-style: italic;">only 24% of computing jobs are held by women</span>.</p>
                <p>Despite the gaps in race and gender found in the technology industry, all this shows is that there is room for improvement. In the U.S. technology sector, there has been a slow increase in racial and gender diversity; however, it's far too slow compared to other sectors in the workforce. One purpose of this site is to highlight this problem and show that there is a place for you in the technology industry.
                    <br>As you can see in the eligibility requirements in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">entry-level roles</span>, obtaining a position in this industry is absolutely doable and will be worth your while. If you are interested in technology, but don't know where to start, there is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">resource tab</span> that can be found in the navigation bar to help you find ways to improve your skills. And if you are interested in technology, but don't know what position you'd be suited for, check out the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quiz</span> this site offers.
                    <br>The fact that none of these percentages are zero shows that there is already a group of people out there in your shoes and are probably willing to lend their support. <strong>No matter your race or gender, there is a place for you!</strong></p>
